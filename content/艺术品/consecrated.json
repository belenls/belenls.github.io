  "body": "**Consagrada (Consecrated)**, September - November 2017.  \\\nSeries of actions. In site installations, performance, durations and dimensions variable.\n\nConsecrated (Consagrada, 2017) was a project that consisted of doing interventions in the bathrooms of ten museums and Cultural Centres in the City of Buenos Aires. I chose bathrooms because I consider them to be meta-private spaces; they are non-places.\n\nFor each intervention, I first went to the museum and checked where the cameras and the security were. Then, I documented the shows on display at that moment in a template or \"board plan\". After making this detailed graphic plan, I created the object/work to be installed in the bathrooms of each location and the labels with the data of the work, copying the same format used by the institution where the intervention was going to take place. By the end of the week, I went again to the museums and installed the works in the bathrooms. These actions were filmed and broadcasted live on social media. None of the interventions were made with the permission of the institutions. \n\n\n\n**List of Interventions**\n\n**Intervention n#1 · Tribute to François Auguste Rodin**\\\nNational Museum of Fine Arts (MNBA) City of Buenos Aires, Argentina.\\\n3D printing of a section of the work \"Pierre de Wissant, Nude Study\" by Rodin. 12 x 10 x 7 cm.\n\n**Intervention n#2 · La Poussière**\\\nPalais de Glace, City of Buenos Aires, Argentina. \\\nWood, acrylic paint, paper. 19 x 19 cm.\n\n**Intervention n#3 · Tres cubos blancos** (Three white cubes)\\\nMACBA, City of Buenos Aires, Argentina. \\\nCardboard, acrylic paint.
