This persistence reveals the constancy and poetry of an artist's diary displayed with mathematical complexity and future durability.\n\nHer geometric combination is fused to a playful and articulated black and white palette, her works build by summation a universe of Pythagorean laws, miniatures that then expand to macro urban projects.\n\nFrom micro wall installations to his virtually created designs, his work reflects on space and its metamorphosis, the possibilities of a work that goes from a Euclidean territory to a more complex typological one as in Escher's works.\n\nArtists such as Sol Lewitt, Alejandro Puente, Richard Deacon, Xul Solar, Hilma Af Klint, Maria Juana Heras Velasco are some of the references we discover in her works.\n\nThis young artist has developed an intense career through museums, fairs and murals throughout the city of Buenos Aires, growing more and better.\\\nWhen the colour multiplies in her work, the geometric order creates a Cosmogonic of Game, of possible and composable worlds, is the magic of the hands of a woman that with the mathematical tools makes flower beauty of the universal forms."
