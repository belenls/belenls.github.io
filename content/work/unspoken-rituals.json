  "body": "A collective digestion\n\nHello dear human,\n\nThis is Unspoken rituals, a collaborative cooking, food-sharing, performance experience. I am asking you to share something you want us to eat together during the residency. It is a collective digestion of thoughts, ideas, emotions and everything in between, the unspoken, the unexplainable, the shared experiences.\n\nPlease write down 140 characters that you would like us to eat. Nobody, not even me, will know what you wrote. This experience is about trust and hope. We trust that the people with whom we share food will nourish us.\n\nWhen you click on send, I will receive only the amount of characters I need to translate, your name and your email. For example, your text might have 5 Nâ€™s, 1 comma, 3 parentheses, etcetera. Then, I will translate the characters you sent into pasta characters using a specific set of character-symbols.\n\nFinally, we will mix all our characters, cook them and eat them together in a collective dinner.\n\nWhen I created the alphabet I created it in Spanish, my native language, but the text can be in English, Spanish or whatever language you feel like using. Bear in mind there might be some characters and some languages not supported by the system at this moment. Please reach out to me if you have any doubts or problems with this topic or with the project.\n\nThank you for being a part of Unspoken Rituals and for trusting and sharing your thoughts <3\n\nWith love,\\\nBelen"
