Eleven canvases of 22 x 20 cm, acrylic paint, push pins.\n\nThis work was created during the residency El Pasaje in Tafí del Valle, Tucumán, Argentina in December 2017. During ten days, I observed the landscape and took a photograph of it each day. With these images, I developed a system to synthesise these images into colours.
