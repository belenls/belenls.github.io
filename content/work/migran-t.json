      "description": "Migran-t is a work in progress. \nAccompanying a physical and spiritual migration from Argentina to the UK, this hair embroidered bedsheet has been a totem and a space of reflection during the process of adaptation to a new ecosystem.\nThis work is part of an antique Victorian and Chinese tradition of embroidering with human hair. Emma Tarlo's book \"Entanglement: The Secret Lives of Hair\" has been a mind opener concerning the context of hair in London and the different cultures it encompasses, each with their own stories of migration."
