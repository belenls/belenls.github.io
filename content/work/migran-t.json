Flat sheet embroidered with human hair. \n150 x 200 cm.\nThis work is part of the public collection of the Taoyuan Museum of Fine Arts (TMoFA)\n\nThis is the first of a series of works where I explore embroidery with human Hair on bedding and canvas. In this series, I navigate feelings of displacement and estrangement present in the act of migrating.  \nOn this bedsheet are embroidered drawings made by me and by my friends, phrases from books and my everyday life, songs and poems collected and stitched for over two years. The front and reverse are exposed, this work is like a flexible skin, a catalogue of sensations, fears and desires that can be read, aired, folded and transported. \n\nPh: Catalina Romero",
