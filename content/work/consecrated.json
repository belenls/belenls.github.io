In site installations, performance, durations and dimensions variable.\n\nConsecrated (Consagrada, 2017) was a project that consisted of intervening the bathrooms of ten museums and Cultural Centres in the City of Buenos Aires.\n\nFor each intervention, I went to a museum and checked the location of security guards and cameras. Then, I documented the shows on display and the collected information in a \"board plan\". \nAfter making this detailed graphic plan, I created the object/work to be installed in the bathrooms of each location and the labels with the data of the work, copying the format used by the museum where the intervention was going to take place. By the end of the week, I went again to the museums and installed the works in the bathrooms. These actions were filmed and broadcast live on Instagram.
