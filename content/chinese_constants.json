  "about": "Belen Santamarina\\\nb. Buenos Aires, Argentina\\\nlives in London, United Kingdom\n\nThrough the use of hair, soil, seeds and food as materials, my works explore the autobiographical and confessional to create tapestries, objects and installations. Reflected in the texts and drawings I embroider, my works engage with personal and collective migration experiences and the use of memories hybridised with science fiction and the natural world to imagine and propose alternative narratives to the dominant discourse.\n\nI use craft techniques I inherited from the women in my family, such as embroidery, crocheting and cooking. These techniques have been systematically secluded to the feminine and domestic space. By employing them, I intend to question the relations of power behind fine arts and crafts while rewriting my story and honouring my roots.\n\nI base my formation on critical study groups and painting workshops. I exhibited my work in Argentina, Taiwan, Spain, the USA and UK. In 2019, I was awarded the Honorary Mention at the Taoyuan International Art Award 2023 in Taiwan. My work Migran-t has been recently acquired by the Taoyuan Museum of Fine Arts, Taiwan (TMoFA).",
